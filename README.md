# minus5-or-multuply3
Thank yo so much for giving me the opportunity. I just wanted to provide my written response to the problem you gave me.

## Getting Started

This project is intended to be used with the latest Active LTS release of [Node.js][nodejs].

### Use as a repository template

To start, just click the **[Use template][repo-template-action]** link (or the green button). Start adding your code in the `src` and unit tests in the `__tests__` directories.

### Clone repository

To clone the repository, use the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/setchevest/minus5-or-multuply3
cd minus5-or-multuply3
npm install
```

# Exercise to be solved
By starting from the number 1 and repeatedly either adding 5 or multiplying by 3, an infinite set of numbers can be produced.How would you write a function that, given a number, tries to find a sequence of such additions and multiplications that produces that number?

## Thank you for teaching me!
